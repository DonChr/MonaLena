# MonaLena
**MonaLena** is a comprehensive C++ image-library for converting color images to grayscale and from grayscale to halftone aka dithering. 
The name is a hommage to Lena Forsen-Soederberg, the Mona-Lisa of the internet age.
The initial idea for this project is by Thomas Krenn, https://www.timitoosystems.com/

A detailed description can be found in ./docs/MonaLenaHandbook.odt or ./docs/MonaLenaHandbook.pdf. The *.pdf file is the exported result of the former. 
This document serves also as a gentle introduction to the field. 
Additionally the code is relative well documented.

The library is self-contained with no external dependencies. The test-driver can read and write *.jpg images.
The ./image subdirectory contains a collection of test-images. 

MonaLena can be freely used for private or educational projects.

Commercial users must ask the Author Dr. Chrilly Donninger at c.donninger@wavenet.at for explicit permission.
